浙江大学研究员/博导，曾任密苏里大学堪萨斯分校助理教授，博士毕业于加拿大多伦多大学

I am actively looking for PhDs, Masters, and RAs with strong mathematics or computer science background. If you are interested, please contact me by sending an email to zthzheng@zju.edu.cn

<!-- News
======
Our paper (first-authored) "Differentially Private Dataset Condensation" was accepted to NDSS AISCC 2024.

I am grateful for receiving the FFE award from UMKC to support our research on AI + Health.

I will serve as the Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology starting from 2024.

Our paper (first-authored) "CMI: Client-Targeted Membership Inference in Federated Learning" was accepted to TDSC.

I am grateful for receiving funding support from Division of Diversity and Inclusion (UMKC) to work on promoting fairness in machine learning.

<!-- I was fortunate to be selected as a [Scialog Fellow](https://rescorp.org/scialog/aut-fellows-and-facilitators)! I am really grateful for the opportunity to work with some outstanding researchers on the topic of AI for Material Discovery. -->
